  # Linux only, on purpose. A bottle-less formula takes Homebrew's
  # build-from-source path, which demands current Command Line Tools to install
  # an already-compiled binary — someone installing a trading agent should not
  # need Xcode. Restricting this here is what makes `brew install
  # de-rus/tap/sixtysix` fall through to the cask on macOS, so one command works
  # on both platforms.
  depends_on :linux

  # Wrapped in on_linux so the formula carries NO url on macOS: an installable
  # formula there wins the name and dies on the requirement above, instead of
  # letting `brew install de-rus/tap/sixtysix` fall through to the cask.

  # No `service do` block on purpose: `sixtysix install` registers the agent
  # with systemd itself. Adding brew services would leave two supervisors
  # fighting over one daemon.

    <<~EOS
      Connect this machine to your account, then run it in the background:

        sixtysix pair <code>     # code from Settings → Connections
        sixtysix install         # start on login, restart on crash

      Broker keys stay in ~/.sixtysix on this machine and are never uploaded.
      Homebrew owns updates here — the agent's self-updater stays off, so
      upgrade with `brew upgrade sixtysix`.
