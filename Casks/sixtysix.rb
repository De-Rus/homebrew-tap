  # macOS gets the cask, not the formula: a formula without a bottle takes
  # Homebrew's build-from-source path, which demands current Command Line Tools
  # to install a binary that is already compiled. Someone installing a trading
  # agent should not need Xcode.

  # The binary is ad-hoc (linker) signed, not notarized. Running it straight
  # from a shell works quarantined, but `sixtysix install` hands it to launchd,
  # which is a stricter launch path — strip the flag rather than find out.

  # Deliberately NOT tearing down launchd here. The LaunchAgent is created by
  # the user running `sixtysix install`, not by this cask, and an `uninstall
  # launchctl:` stanza will happily unregister — and delete the plist of — an
  # agent that was installed by some other route entirely. That is a live
  # trading daemon; a dangling job is recoverable, a silently stopped one is
  # not. `sixtysix uninstall` is the supported way to remove the service, and
  # `brew uninstall --zap` sweeps it for anyone who wants everything gone.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Connect this machine to your account, then run it in the background:

      sixtysix pair <code>     # code from Settings → Connections
      sixtysix install         # start on login, restart on crash

    Broker keys stay in ~/.sixtysix on this machine and are never uploaded.
    Homebrew owns updates here — the agent's self-updater stays off, so
    upgrade with `brew upgrade --cask sixtysix`.

    To remove: `sixtysix uninstall` stops the background service first, then
    `brew uninstall --cask sixtysix`. Add --zap to also delete ~/.sixtysix,
    which holds your broker keys.
